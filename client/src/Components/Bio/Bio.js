            <p>Man cannot drive away impassioned thoughts unless he watches over his desire and incensive power. 
               He destroys desire through fasting, vigils and sleeping on the ground, and he tames his incensive power 
               through long- suffering, forbearance, forgiveness and acts of compassion. 
               For with these two passions are connected almost all the demonic thoughts which lead the intellect to disaster and perdition. 
               It is impossible to overcome these passions unless we can rise above attachment to food and possessions, to self-esteem and even to our very body, 
               because it is through the body that the demons often attempt to attack us. It is essential, then, to imitate people who are in danger at sea and 
               throw things overboard because of the violence of the winds and the threatening waves. But here we must be very careful in case we 
               cast things overboard just to be seen doing so by men. For then we shall get the reward we want; but we shall suffer another shipwreck, 
               worse than the first, blown off our course by the contrary wind of the demon of self-esteem. That is why our Lord, instructing the intellect, 
               our helmsman, says in the Gospels: 'Take heed that you do not give alms in front of others, to be seen by them; for unless you take heed, 
               you will have no reward from your Father in heaven.' Again, He says: 'When you pray, you must not be as the hypocrites are: for they love 
               to pray standing in synagogues and at street-corners, so as to be seen by men. Truly I say to you, they get the reward they want. . . . 
               Moreover when you fast, do not put on a gloomy face, like the hypocrites;</p>
